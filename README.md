# IceCube - Neutrinos in Deep Ice

The goal is to predict a neutrino particleâ€™s direction. You will develop a model based on data from the "IceCube" detector, which observes the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice.

Help scientists better understand exploding stars, gamma-ray bursts, and cataclysmic phenomena involving black holes, neutron stars and the fundamental properties of the neutrino itself.
